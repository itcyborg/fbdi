            <h3>Welcome To Our Organisation</h3>
            <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
            <p>Founded in March 2012, Faith-based Development Initiative (FBDI) is a
                non-governmental organization promoting conflict prevention, peace-building
                and sustainable development in South Sudan through the scripture, inspirational
                debates/dialogues, youth rehabilitation, humanitarian assistance, and
                livelihood skills training.
                A dynamic organization with a proven track record, Faith-based Development
                Initiative has successfully implemented the following projects or activities
                since its founding in March 2012:

                    <span class="fa fa-5x fa-book" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <h3>National Day of Prayer</h3>
                    <p>Following the signing of the Agreement for the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (ARCISS) in
                        August 2015, FBDI initiated the implementation of the first ever National Day of Prayer which
                        was successfully conducted on March 10, 2017. This event brought together thousands of South
                        Sudanese citizens, government officials, civil society members, and church leaders to reflect
                        and pray for a peaceful South Sudan.</p>

                    <h3>Biblical Analysis </h3>
                    <p>For the last two years, Faith-based Development Initiative has been supporting experts from
                        various Christian denominations to provide biblical analysis and interpretation relevant to the
                        attainment of conflict resolution, harmony, and sustainable peace in South Sudan. These biblical
                        analysis and expert interpretations were disseminated through radios, televisions and
                        newspapers. </p>

                    <span class="fa fa-5x fa-hand-peace-o" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <h3>Peace Advocacy</h3>
                    <p>Between January 2014 and August 2015, Faith-based Development Initiative, along with other civil
                        society organizations, participated in Addis Ababa Peace Agreement that culminated in the
                        signing of the Agreement for the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan. We continue to engage
                        with other civil society organizations and all parties o the conflict to bring about a lasting
                        peace in South Sudan</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 chrt_grid" style="visibility: visible; -webkit-animation-delay: 0.4s;height: 350px;">

                    <span class="fa fa-5x fa-child" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <h3>Child Protection</h3>
                    <p>Since 2014, Faith-based Development Initiative has been providing shelter, psychosocial support,
                        and educational scholarships to children affected conflicts and forced displacement. This
                        project was initiated following an outbreak of violent conflicts between Bari farmers and Dinka
                        pastoralists in early 2014, which led to loss of lives, displacement of civilians, and a number
                        of other humanitarian catastrophes. </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4 col-sm-12 col-xs-12 chrt_grid" style="visibility: visible; -webkit-animation-delay: 0.4s;height: 350px;">
                <div class="chrty">
                    <span class="fa fa-5x fa-mortar-board" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <h3>Training of Pastors</h3>
                    <p>In April 2012, we organized workshop training at Juba Bridge Hotel, bringing together over 100
                        pastors from various Christian denominations, ethnicities, and linguistic groups. The objective
                        of the training was to help churches and Christians of different ethnic, cultural, and
                        linguistic backgrounds to harmonize hymns and spirituals so that it is easy to worship and
                        praise collectively, both at the local and national levels. Consequently, a rich ensemble of
                        worship and praise literature in simple English and Pidgin Arabic was developed and
                        disseminated. </p>
