            <h3>Proposed Projects/ Activities</h3>
            <p>
                Based on an assessment and analysis of current humanitarian situation in South Sudan,
                the Faith-based
                Development Initiative plans to focus its activities in the following key areas:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="charitys">
            <div class="col-md-4 chrt_grid" style="visibility: visible; -webkit-animation-delay: 0.4s;">
                <div class="chrty">
                    <span class="fa fa-5x fa-hand-peace-o" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <h3>Peace Building and Advocac</h3>
                    <p>This project area will focus on bringing together youth from diverse and often conflicting ethnic groups—but with shared faith—to interact, dialogue, and return to their communities fully empowered to bridge critical gaps and address some of the country’s most pressing ethnic and tribal conflicts. We will do this by convening workshops, dialogues, debates, and dramas at national universities, civic engagement centers and secondary schools across the country and then disseminating these messages through radio, television, and newspapers. Major conflict prone areas such Wau, Bor, Juba, Malakal will be given preeminence.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 chrt_grid" style="visibility: visible; -webkit-animation-delay: 0.4s;">
                <div class="chrty">
                    <span class="fa fa-5x fa-plus" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <h3>Border Humanitarian Response </h3>
                    <p>The ongoing conflict in South Sudan has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee across the borders (Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Congo) while an additional 2 million people are internally displaced. Thousands more continue to cross the borders due to recent intensified fighting between Murle and Dinka and are often stranded without access to food and basic social services. As such, Faith-based Development Initiative seeks to provide these fleeing refugees with cross border humanitarian assistance, psychosocial support, and documentation services necessary for them to resettle in neighboring countries, starting with the Kenya (Nadapal) and Uganda (Kaya) borders. </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 chrt_grid" style="visibility: visible; -webkit-animation-delay: 0.4s;">
                <div class="chrty">
                    <span class="fa fa-5x fa-shield" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <h3>Emergency Child Protection & Rehabilitation Centers </h3>
                    <p>South Sudan’s ongoing conflict and near economic collapse have forced vulnerable children out of homes and become street beggars. If not taken care of, these deserving children will continue to grow in numbers and post threat to security and stability in the country.

                        So, building upon our existing child protection program, we plan on expanding efforts in this area by developing emergency homes for abandoned and orphaned children/youth and providing them access to counseling, educational, and other rehabilitation services.   </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4 chrt_grid" style="visibility: visible; -webkit-animation-delay: 0.4s;">
                <div class="chrty">
                    <span class="fa fa-5x fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <h3>Livelihood Training and Access to Microfinance </h3>
                    <p>According to a study conducted by Mercy Corps (2014), most of South Sudanese youth are illequipped and lack basic skills they need to succeed in today’s competitive global market. To help reverse this trend, we plan on providing our vulnerable youth with entrepreneurial and livelihood skills training and access to microfinance and other important financial services. We plan to partner with other civil society organizations as well as South Sudan Microfinance and the Cooperative Bank of South Sudan to socially and economically empower these youth.</p>
